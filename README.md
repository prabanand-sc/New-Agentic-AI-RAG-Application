# LangGraph: Build Stateful Agentic AI Graph

This project demonstrates a sophisticated, stateful AI agent built using **LangGraph**. The application serves as an intelligent news aggregator and summarizer, capable of performing complex tasks like tool calling, data structuring, and generating dynamic summaries based on user queries.

The user interface is built with **Streamlit**, providing a clean and interactive way to engage with the AI agent.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Stateful Agentic Architecture**: Utilizes LangGraph to create agents that maintain memory and state across interactions.
  * **Dynamic Tool Calling**: The agent can autonomously decide to use tools (e.g., a news API) to fetch real-time, relevant information.
  * **Multi-LLM Support**: Easily switch between different Large Language Models like **Groq, Llama, Gemini**, and others.
  * **Structured Data Output**: The agent can process unstructured data from the web and present it in a clean, structured format like a table.
  * **On-Demand News Analysis**: Provides various views of news data, from high-level summaries to detailed weekly digests.

## üöÄ Application Showcase

Here are a few snapshots of the agent in action, demonstrating its different capabilities.

### 1\. Basic Conversational Summary

The agent provides a concise, high-level summary of the latest news, covering key events in different regions and topics.

### 2\. Agent with Tool Calling & Structured Output

This view shows the agent's "thought process." It starts by executing a **Tool Call** to fetch raw data. It then processes this information and presents the most critical news in a structured, easy-to-read table.

### 3\. Weekly News Explorer

The agent can generate a curated summary of news for specific periods, complete with headlines and source links, allowing users to catch up on the week's events at a glance.
